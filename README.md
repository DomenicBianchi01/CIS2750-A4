# CIS2750-A4

This was the last assingment in CIS 2750 and is a combination of all three previous assignments. 

This assignment replaces the file storage system that was being used in A3 to save posts to the board with a mySQL server.

One of the restrictions of the assignment was that the server could only be contacted using C.
